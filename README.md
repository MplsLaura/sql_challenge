# Description

Research project using company data about employees with the company during the 1980s and 1990s. Only six CSV files remain from that period.


# Data Modeling

An Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables was created using QuickDBDLinks.


# Data Engineering

A table schema was created for each of the six CSV files. Each CSV file was imported into its corresponding SQL table.


# Data Analysis

The following queries were created:

The employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

The first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

The manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

The department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

The first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

Each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

Each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

The frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
